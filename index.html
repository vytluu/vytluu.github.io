<div  class="paragraph editable-text" style=" text-align: center; display: block; ">Hello ^^&nbsp;<br /><br />My name is Harry Pham aka MangoSashimi on SSF. &nbsp;Thought I would have a little page here where i could talk a little bit about SNSD, how i came to be a S&hearts;NE, and how they have affected me.&nbsp; First, however, i would like to just point out that i am not good at expressing myself with words, although i do believe i am improving.&nbsp; So, i will try my best, but how much i truly love SNSD, i can never fully show in words.&nbsp; At points, i'm sure i'll sound awkward, but oh well. Sorry for all my grammar mistakes.&nbsp; This is written mostly for my sake.&nbsp; Trying to see if i can put into words how i feel.&nbsp; At times, if not all the time, my fanboy-ness will show ;3&nbsp; Think of this paragraph as a disclaimer of sorts.<br /><br />~<br />"It's beauty that captures your attention; personality which captures your heart"<br />~<br /><br />If i had to pinpoint the first time i really noticed SNSD, I'd definitely say California.&nbsp; Friday, September 25th, 2009. Boy was that a date that has changed my life. Going over there on a college trip with my dad and sister, we also visited my dad's cousin's home and stayed there for awhile.&nbsp; My second cousins, who were into Korean pop and dramas, started playing the Gee mv quite a few times when i was there.&nbsp; Before then, i was not into Korean music at all.&nbsp; I didn't even listen to music much in general. &nbsp; I just never found a taste for American music and only listened to it on the radio while in the car.&nbsp; Any who, i didn't really "listen" to the song the first few times.&nbsp; That was probably because I was already negatively biased towards Kpop, remembering the days when my sister would blast the same song over and over again.&nbsp; She might have played an SNSD song once or twice before, but, i never noticed.&nbsp; Back to Gee mv, I remember thinking how pretty the girls were.&nbsp; Just, beautiful.&nbsp; I remember thinking the member (who i later found out to be Tiffany), was really beautiful. With hindsight, maybe this was because her lines at the beginning of the song were the only lyrics i understood. I believe that night and the next few days, my second cousins also played Genie mv once or twice and the Kissing You mv.&nbsp; I remember my sister and second cousin talking about scandals, not in a bad way, but just like "oh did you hear" i suppose.&nbsp; They were mostly about Tiffany.&nbsp; Short skirts, etc.&nbsp; Whatever.&nbsp; A few girls in Gee mv scenes really made me just go "wow.".&nbsp; Later, i found out those two were Yuri and Yoona, the "twins" of the group. &nbsp;<br /><br />So, after the college trip.&nbsp; On the way home on the plane.&nbsp; My sister and I watched a few Family Outing eps on her laptop that the older brother had put on there.&nbsp; I remember thinking Hyori and Jae Suk were hilarious.&nbsp; But, it seemed like my subconscious has other things it was thinking about.&nbsp; I kept thinking of that one Gee song, but was frustrated because i didn't know any of the lyrics so i could think of is the beat.&nbsp; Just simmering in my brain~<br /><br />Back home.&nbsp; Haha, that's when it got hectic.&nbsp; I remember it took me two weeks to learn their names.&nbsp; Hardest for me were Hyoyeon and Seohyun.&nbsp; I guess it was because those names seemed the most "Korean" to me.&nbsp; Didn't know how to pronounce them either.Now that i think about it, I am not even sure how i managed to do that much Soshi stuff and watch those shows in that amount of time.&nbsp; So much watched and so much learned...&nbsp; Right here, my memory becomes a little blurry.&nbsp; I remember just generally searching "SNSD" on Google and Youtube.&nbsp; Got some mv's, fan vids, concerts, etc.&nbsp; I remember they made me laugh a lot lol.&nbsp; Eventually, of course, i found Soshified.&nbsp; At first, i was hesitant of joining.&nbsp; I didn't know much about the girls, and didn't know if i could contribute to anything useful.&nbsp; For those of you that know me, silent type lol.&nbsp; But, i joined. Community there is amazing.&nbsp; Probably the best out of all the forums i have ever joined, and i've been to a lot of forums in my fish-days. &nbsp;It is just a great community there, everyone having the same common love and interest. &nbsp;Ah, YoonYul Skype chatrooms... :)<br /><br />Antis.&nbsp; Of course, when you search on Google, your bound to get both sides of the spectrum.&nbsp; I never seen such..passion before in the kpop world. &nbsp;On both sides of the spectrum. &nbsp;You have fans, such as I i guess, who love the girls, and others who hate them with an intense passion. &nbsp;I, mistakenly, read some anti posts about SNSD. Most memorable one was about Tiffany, how she didn't wear her underwear or w/e and Yoona was pointing it out&lt;-Not true as cleared up on a radio.&nbsp; How she was the "slut" of the group.&nbsp; Blegh.&nbsp; Before this, i didn't even know what an anti was.&nbsp; Someone not only not liking an artist(s) music, but hating them and trying to defame/ridicule them? I remember thinking how anyone do stuff like this, it just disgusted me.&nbsp; Not just snsd-antis, but antis to any artists.&nbsp; If you don't like them, simply ignore them and don't follow them. No need to bash.Tiffany seemed like such a sweet girl that i didn't get why anyone would try to do this.&nbsp; After that, i stayed away from anti stuff, because they just angered me.&nbsp; Another incident was Dream Concert 2008, Cassiopaeans and E.L.F.S, but mainly Cassiopaeans organized "light sticks off" when SNSD performed.&nbsp; Just silence and no lights.&nbsp; I saw a vid of girl fans standing in the isles holding signs directing people.&nbsp; I can't even say how mad that made me.&nbsp; How hard the girls had worked, to be treated like this.&nbsp; No one deserves to be treated like this. &nbsp;I didn't hate DBSK though, i love their music, just the anti-fan Cassiopaeans.&nbsp; These days, it doesn't bother me as much. &nbsp; It's kinda sad seeing it though, because SNSD are in the same company with DBSK and Super Junior so they are bound to be good friends. &nbsp;It's been seen multiple times too from selcas or interviews when they talk about each other. I, for one, love SM Town lol. &nbsp;SNSD, DBSK, and Super Junior are my top three favorite groups.&nbsp;<br /><br />A recent event made me mad *well not so recent now*, well, more like a feeling of sadness was SNSD's performance at White Day Concert.&nbsp; Some people started throwing green lightsticks at them.&nbsp; My first feeling was, of course, anger.&nbsp; But then i remembered that this was SNSD.&nbsp; Professionalism was win when Sooyoung kept her cool and asked whoever who threw their lightstick to come and get it.&nbsp; Felt like punching whoever had thrown the lightstick if i had been there.&nbsp; Then, i remembered again, that this was SNSD.&nbsp; What S&hearts;NE fans do not only reflect what other people/fans think of S&hearts;NES, but also of SNSD.&nbsp; Quote from Wenfany on Soshified "We are angry, hurt, sad, worried, pissed. We are going to show the WORLD that SONEs are here for SNSD always. People can try, but they will never get to the girls because SONEs are this strong, this good, to protect the kids."<br /><br />Back to me becoming a S&hearts;NE..<br /><br />I started finding out that SNSD had shows. Korean entertainment introduced me to the concept of the "variety show". &nbsp;Those shows are a major factor in becoming a fan because you get to see a different view of snsd, or any kpop group in general, and see how they are still humans like us. &nbsp;I found Soshified's youtube acc which had a lot of subbed shows, especially older ones.&nbsp; I believe that Hello Baby came out around that time?&nbsp; Dang though, my love grew for the girls with each show i watched.&nbsp; I don't even remember the order in which i watched them.&nbsp; Girls go to School, each member's MTV Lifestyle episode, Factory Girl, Yoona's Manwon Happiness vs Big Bang Seungri, Horror Factory, Unstoppable Marriage Yuri/Sooyoung cuts (made me fall in love with Yuri haha), Intimate Note, radio cuts, Wonderful Outing, Hello Baby. I'm sure i missed a lot.&nbsp; Just random clips and such.&nbsp; Ah, i also remember seeing those fanvids of SNSD funny moments.&nbsp; Girls were such dorks, which made them even more lovable. &nbsp;My love for them just skyrocketed higher and higher with each passing day. &nbsp;<br /><br />Why do i love SNSD so much? I really don't know, i can't explain it.&nbsp; All i know is that it isn't for their looks alone.&nbsp; I don't believe such a superficial liking could bring me this far.&nbsp; That's why i'm always a bit hesitant to let people know i'm a big fan of snsd. &nbsp;Knowing only a little bit about them, they probably would think i like them solely because of looks. Of course, I think&nbsp; Yuri is the epitome of perfection and beauty, but her personality is a major factor as to why i think that.&nbsp; Same goes for all the members. &nbsp;I just loved their looks, personalities, songs, talents, shows, quirks, flaws, just everything. &nbsp;Their super strong Soshi bond that they share.&nbsp; I truly say i have never loved anyone ,outside of family and friends, this much.&nbsp; This surpassed my past hobbies: fish keeping&lt;-lol major hobby, gaming, my small dabble into the RC world. Transcends way over any of my past hobbies, that's for sure.&nbsp;<br /><br />I guess it's weird for an outsider's standpoint to see how i could possibly love SNSD's songs.&nbsp; A lot of them are all cutesy and bubblegum-esque. I know the lyrics to those songs in English, but i think if those songs were sung with English lyrics and i understood it all the time, then i might just get bored of them too.&nbsp; Maybe.&nbsp; But i just love SNSD's songs because of their voices.&nbsp; Just hearing their voices is soothing.&nbsp; Now, i'm not saying that SNSD have the best vocals out of all groups.&nbsp; Although Taeyeon's voice is just angelic and dazzling.&nbsp; A comparison i used once was like my head was like a radio, and SNSD voices were the perfect frequency for my radio.&nbsp; Hearing their voices is the best way to make me happy, to cheer me up, to calm me down, to relax me if I'm angry.&nbsp; When i hear their songs or sing them in my head, i don't usually think of the lyrics as applying to myself or what i feel, but I imagine the girls singing and how they feel if that makes sense. &nbsp;There are seriously some SNSD songs that i thought i would never like, but they slowly caught on and now i just love them. &nbsp;It happens with English songs too. &nbsp;I don't listen to any English songs these days but i love it when SNSD sings covers of English songs or does a dance to one. *Rhythm Nation*<br /><br />I think a large part of my love came from watching shows.&nbsp; Girls go to School.&nbsp; That show was just wow.&nbsp; I saw how hard the girls worked and how dedicated they were.&nbsp; It was just amazing, and i don't think i could ever have gone through half the hell they went through.&nbsp; It wasn't mentioned in the show, but going through years of training your butt of, not knowing if you were actually gonna debut in the end? Some of the members were so dedicated, having to go to school for the first half of the day, and dance practice for the latter and still manage hw.&nbsp; Learning that Taeyeon had to leave her family to go to Seoul and train.&nbsp; In the show, seeing the girls work so hard, be so excited to perform, crying.&nbsp; Jessica working so hard that she pretty much faints.&nbsp; I still see that spark today as they perform.&nbsp; They don't become arrogant, they still remember their training days.&nbsp; Always humble and grateful for every award they win.&nbsp; Grateful that they have a stage to perform on, which is more than can be said about many new rookie groups. &nbsp;On the other side, i saw Hello Baby.&nbsp; Soshi bond stood out to me there.&nbsp; I came to learn more about them and their personalities.&nbsp; How they love each other, but can also play pranks on each other like true siblings. &nbsp;Im Choding and her salty kimbabs lol. &nbsp;Sure, people can say that its just an on screen act, but i don't think the way the girls act towards each other can be something only shown on screen.&nbsp; All the shows are unique too.&nbsp; Horror Factory was just hilarious, showing the girls in different environments as the girls tried acting. &nbsp;They reveal a different side each time. &nbsp;<br /><br />Hello Baby.&nbsp; I'm rewatching/finishing that show now.&nbsp; This is just an amazing show where you get to see each member's personality.&nbsp; I thought i loved it the first time i watch the first 10 or so eps.&nbsp; As i watch it again now, i love it even more.&nbsp; I know each member better, and love seeing those YoonYul moments and seeing how they act exactly as people describe their personality. &nbsp;And yes! I ship YoonYul xD Favorite. pairing. ever. Such playful dorks, but the bond between them runs so far back.. It's just a beautiful thing to see. &nbsp;Plus YoonYul Troopers are awesome to talk with lol.<br /><br />As someone on SSF said (sorry, can't find the post at the minute), SNSD is an "oddity". &nbsp;Here are&nbsp; 9 girls, in an extremely competitive environment, pretty much dog eat dog.&nbsp; Yet, they are so selfless.&nbsp; They don't fight with each other to become more popular, but care for each other like a family.&nbsp; It's just odd.&nbsp; Yeah, i really need to find that post... My sum of what the guy said is really bad...<br /><br />Example of Soshi bond? Tiffany talking about her mother on&nbsp; Kim Jungeun's Chocolate show.&nbsp; I am not gonna lie, tears came to my eyes when i saw the vid.&nbsp; This was shortly after i had read those anti-accounts about Tiffany.&nbsp; This quote, i still remember today " It is something I would like to say to my mother. Dont cry kids! This is the first time I am speaking of it in a broadcasted show. To my mother: even though you left before me, you gave me eight other sisters. To mom and God, I thank you." After that, any attempt of anti's at Fany became null and void.&nbsp; You can't just show SNSD's bond with one example though.&nbsp; It comes through the accumulation of multiple shows,clips,pics, fan accounts and the like.&nbsp; Just that one moment where there true love shows.&nbsp; When it isn't just a "camera act" because they don't think anyone is filming them.<br /><br />&nbsp;This is where it gets a bit more..difficult for me lol.&nbsp;<br /><br />I can say that SNSD changed my life.&nbsp; No joke. Not in a shallow way either.&nbsp; In a big way that impacts how i look at life.&nbsp; I'm not going to lie, before this, i've had "bad" thoughts about actors and such, girls etc.&nbsp; Hormones and whatnot&nbsp; i suppose haha.&nbsp; But with SNSD, they just rise right above that.&nbsp; It's not even possible for me to think of them like that, like, i just can't.&nbsp; Never have, and never will.&nbsp; They just seem so pure to me, so..different that i just stopped.&nbsp; There.&nbsp; Drew the line.&nbsp; I'm not saying i'm the best person now, i'm not.&nbsp; I still have my flaws.&nbsp; However, i believe that SNSD has made me a better person morally, making me think twice about some stuff i do.&nbsp; To look inwardly at myself first. &nbsp;They have made me grown more mature. &nbsp;Crazy as it sounds seeing as i have never seen seen them in real life, although hopefully one day i will.. But, whenever i do something now, i just think of SNSD.&nbsp; It somehow helps me.&nbsp; Call is Soshism, the new religion. Nine angels if you will.&nbsp; I find myself happier these days.&nbsp; "WWSD, What would Soshi do?". They just give me strength. Not like i was constantly sad or depressed before September 25th, 2009 or anything.&nbsp; But when i think back on it, i just wonder what would happen now if SNSD just disappeared from my life.&nbsp; A massive void would appear. Sometimes I have crappy days at school, but just seeing that one vid, gif, or pic of snsd, especially of kkabyul, can make me smile and laugh.&nbsp; If i had a camcorder in front of my computer, i'm sure i would look quite silly.&nbsp; I could be sad, but without noticing it, i suddenly feel myself smiling when i see something SNSD related.&nbsp; In a way, SNSD are my role models.&nbsp; I guess it is because they live life to the fullest in this roller coaster of a ride called So Nyuh Shi Dae.&nbsp; *Lol, i can't think of something as epic as "roller coaster of a ride called So Nyuh Shi Dae", i just remember reading that somewhere and thought it applied here*. &nbsp;They motivate me to work harder in school, to form closer bonds with my friends.&nbsp;<br />Nowadays, SNSD means a lot more to mean than just singers. &nbsp;I think they fit the definition of "idol" in its truest sense.<br /><br />What type of fan am I? Definately not the jealous type.&nbsp; Haha, this is where i reread old convos (Sorry you-know-who-you-are, i gotta do it).&nbsp; Might copy paste a few things i said here too.&nbsp; So, for those of you who don't know, my favorite member of all time is Yuri.&nbsp; Ok, I'm going to talk about Yuri for a bit.<br /><br />Yuri.&nbsp; This girl.&nbsp; Favorite member since day one, and i don't see that position budging one bit.&nbsp; When i saw the Gee mv, she just caught my eye.&nbsp; Who is that amazing girl in the green who just saluted? She was just dazzling.&nbsp; Of course, i messed her up with Yoona.&nbsp; These days, i don't even see how i could not differentiate between the two.&nbsp; It's like night and day.&nbsp; Still love Yoona though, YoonYul couple is legit haha.&nbsp; But man, i just fell for Yuri.&nbsp; Black Pearl, what a fitting name (even though i really don't see how she is much more tan compared to the other members).&nbsp; Not only a beautiful pearl, but a rare black one.&nbsp; Of course, seeing clips of her just made me love her more.&nbsp; No no no no no~ while Fany is too the side with a poker face.&nbsp; Sigh.&nbsp; Yuri is just everything.&nbsp; Dorky, cute, funny, elegant, mean (prankster), gangster, pretty, sexy, and most of all, just beautiful.&nbsp; She can just pull anything off. Arg, wish i could find that post that a member on Soshified posted about her, i think it perfectly describes her, and is said much more elegantly...&nbsp; I could just go on and on about Yuri though.&nbsp; I'm &nbsp;so happy for her these days, she is growing more popular.&nbsp; Back then, Taeyeon, Yoona, Tiffany, and Jessica were more in the spotlight.&nbsp; However, Yuri's gotten more popular these days with Invincible Youth.&nbsp; And of course, her solo dance to Ciara's 1,2 Step at SNSD's first solo concert.&nbsp; Her "Golden Age" as one article put it.&nbsp; I'm proud to say that i was a Yuri fan from day one, and that she didn't automatically become my favorite after she grew more popular with her more mature/sexy side. &nbsp;I have so many pics of Yuri. &nbsp;A lot of the pictures look a bit repetitive, but i see something different in every single one.&nbsp; Any picture in which i see Yuri having fun and enjoying what she does is what makes me most happy. &nbsp;I loved KkabYul first for being the dork she is, and i still love seeing when she is trying to be serious during dances, but lets that little grin slip showing that she is having the time of her life. &nbsp;I think only one of my friends knows exactly just how much i admire this girl haha. &nbsp;She seriously is gaining so much attention these days. &nbsp;Lee Hyori and Seo In Young both said that they admire/have their eye on Yuri. &nbsp;<br /><br />Okay, so i found the post that i love so much describing Yuri, feel free to read it.&nbsp; It's super long but Yuri deserves this much space, and more.&nbsp; Skip down to the long lines of <FONT size="3">~~~ </FONT>to get back to where i start talking again.<br /><br />Credits all go to Auratus on Soshified and his/her amazing writing skills:<br /><br />"The following is my opinion, about Kwon Yuri, the hottest of the hot.<br /><br />Without a doubt, she is the sexiest idol. Flat out. No argument will sway me. Hot. Super hot. Several thousand degrees hotter than incandescent. Yuri's hotness would blow away every model that's ever posed in any men's mag. She's just perfection made female. Really, there's no other description that does her justice.<br /><br />But what does it mean to be both smokin AND an idol in Soshi? The Black Pearl could have been a high wire act.<br /><br />The first time I saw Yuri, actually noticed her as a person was in the Chuesok Idol Special, their training room practice footage. I thought she was Yoona. (Cut me a little slack. It was a fairly grainy video.)<br /><br />But even with how poor the video quality was, she drew the eyes. That was when I was trying to figure out who was who in the group, and the only one I knew with long black hair was Yoona. Yes, Yoona was sporting short colored hair at the time, but I had just gotten done watching the Gee video, aka Yoona of the long black locks and Yuri was the closest match. Only I realized, that's not Yoona, she's much hotter than Yoona. And wow, whoever she is, she has presence.<br /><br />Check out her solo bit in the Chocolate MV, when she's on the glass bed. That my friends, is the pinnacle of her using her talents. She's not a very strong vocalist, but she uses what she has to devastating results.<br /><br />HOW did she get so hot? Certainly genetics helped, but that's at most half of the equation. You know the saying, 'my body is a temple'? Yuri wrote that, or could have. She cares for her body, she trains it, sculpts it. Yoga was invented for her, or should have been. In a group of 9 outstanding individuals, women who've trained for years to maximize what they were born with, Yuri is simply in a class of her own. She took what Momma gave her and ran with it. <br /><br />Body builders take an aspect of this to a different extreme, where it's more about delineation, size and raw intimidation. It's a severe display of the potential of the human genome. But she's not a statue meant for posing. She's delightfully dynamic, and in this artificial situation that requires such delicate balance she is the best in the game. The best in K-Popdom.<br /><br />What do I mean by that? She's simply perfect at walking a tightrope. And it IS a balancing act. Yuri, or any K-Pop idol for that matter, has to balance public expectation, personal pride, ridiculous schedules and arduous training. Being an idol is NOT easy. Examine for instance the hypocritical duality in the demands of the adoring public. An idol has to be sexy, but not too sexy. An idol has to know her perfect type, but never actually go out on a date. An idol has to be both virginal and alluring. She has to be both modest, and prideful, and not look like she's being coy about it either. <br /><br />And she has to sell that duality. That's unsaid in Korean society. It's a given, everyone in the showbiz industry there knows it. If they've done too good a job selling the notion, of being too sexy, the oncoming backlash can be counted to hit within minutes. <br /><br />Think about that for a moment. They have to flaunt it, make the audience want it, dangle it out there, but not for an instant, MEAN IT. This is beyond difficult. There's simply nothing analogous to it in the Hollywood scene. It's like playing chicken, but instead of pink-slips, it's their career on the line, or the reputation of the group they're in.<br /><br />Let's contrast Yuri with Hyuna, from G7 and 4Minute. I love Hyuna. In G7, she's the whiny maknae, she's silly, immature and adorable. But in her solo activities, her image is all about the sexy. I'd say she's much more risque than Yuri. But for her, it's just an act. Watch her for 1 minute on G7 and you're hard pressed to see the connection between her and the dancer in 4Minute. That's why she can get away with doing what she does.<br /><br />But Yuri is Yuri. She's hot opening a can of tuna, or punching microwave buttons.<br /><br />Let's contrast her to Park Gyuri (who I really like), Kara's leader. Gyuri's arrogance and belief in her looks is her shtick. If Yuri were to mimic her attitude, proclaim what is actually true, it would be too much, and a backlash would set in. When you truly are gifted, to be accepted, you have to downplay it, you have to be humble.<br /><br />How does she maintain her image? There's the outward superhot goddess, and then there's the goof, the tongue-sticking-out-while-napping, talking-to-herself dork carrying a Yoona doll. She deflates her hotness by not taking it too seriously. Underneath the outward facing fire is the rest of Yuri. The good daughter that she becomes in a social setting displays her automatic dimming abilities. You can see the full spectrum of Yuri in Invincible Youth. Whenever she's hugging one of the ajummas, she's just a girl who really feels the hug. You can even see the ajummas sometimes get taken aback, here's this famous idol, who's hugging like a real daughter. Like all the members, her family is the most important thing to her. <br /><br />So, beyond the hotness, there's the daughter, the clown and the goof. But after watching more and more of their interactions, I get a feeling that Yuri has a softness and vulnerability to her. She loves attention, and works hard to capture the eyes of any audience, but within the group her feelings are closer to the surface than the majority of the members. She's sensitive and genuine. She's really bad at trying to fake her emotions.<br /><br />So here my picture of WHY Soshi is so exceptional is starting to come into focus. Soshi has the best leader in Taeyeon, the best maknae in Seohyun, the cutest member in Sunny, the best dancer in Hyoyeon, the coolest presence in Jessica, the most heart in Tiffany, the best enforcer in Sooyoung, the strongest idol in Yoona, and the hottest member in Yuri, who can be such a draw and still maintain the true meaning of Soshi. Really, each of them contributes their best qualities to the Soshi gestalt. It's no wonder they dominate their industry."<br /><FONT size="3"><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</FONT><br /><br />So, do i get jealous when i see her with Kim Tae Woo? No.&nbsp; Truthfully, no.&nbsp; My love for Yuri, and for all the members goes to me wanting anything for them that will make them happy.&nbsp; If they make a decision and are happy with it, then i'm happy. Simple as that.&nbsp; An example i used awhile back was: "Does it make sense for a fan to get jealous when their idol has a bf/gf? Would their idol be happy at them for hating on their bf/gf?" This goes for all the idols i listen to btw. &nbsp;I believe a true fan would support their idol with whatever the choose to do.&nbsp; Yuri seems happy with her interaction with KTW.&nbsp; To me, it seems more of like a brother-sister relationship lol.&nbsp; KTW and his multiple ideal girls hehe.&nbsp; I thought it was funny when Yuri's mom told her not to trust him. &nbsp;The girls don't belong to me or any other fan.&nbsp; I'm not the type of fan that fantasizes that he is going to marry Yuri.&nbsp; Although i think meeting her would be a plausible event in the future after college if i got to a fansign/meet or something.&nbsp; &nbsp;I just hope i don't become speechless by becoming too dazzled/intimidated lol. &nbsp;Back on topic... I also said that night when i was trying to define what i feel: "you love someone to the point that you are behind them 100% as long as what they do makes them happy.&nbsp; No regrets at all."&nbsp; All the girls seem like they want to get married and live a normal life. &nbsp;Who am i to hold them back from their wish? It's quite sad that they are not allowed to be in relationships while being idols because of the irrationality of other fans.&nbsp; I wish Yuri could have/show more interactions with other guy colleagues. &nbsp;At least she must be meeting new people in college :)<br /><br />So, i remember reading this description of "Yuri-type Fans" on SSF. &nbsp;The more i read it, the more freaked out about how it almost perfectly describes me xD Credits go to Soy, amazing founder of SSF:<br /><br />"The 9th type of fan is one that I am oh-too-familiar with. Yuri fans are not afraid to tell you about how perfect Yuri is. In fact, there really isn&rsquo;t much of a purpose for Yuri fans, they just admire Yuri, in every single way. They really believe the girl can do no wrong, and when she does do something wrong, they just think it&rsquo;s hilarious. Even when Yuri jokes or screws the other girls over, these fans are laughing most of the time, and think that Yuri is the perfect genius when it comes to joking around. They know the &ldquo;Oh Duri&rdquo; imitation and know Yuri&rsquo;s voice from a mile a way. They have Yuri sense, and they have the ability to forcefully make any conversation about Yuri. They love Yuri&rsquo;s random English spurts of &ldquo;Oh Honey&rdquo; or &ldquo;Today is Monday&rdquo;, and believe that the language barrier with Yuri is only temporary, and that one day she will be a prodigy. These fans are hardcore Yuri fans, and will stalk every SNSD video and just monitor what Yuri does. Oh and all of them acknowledge Yusica, even if it&rsquo;s not their favorite pairing. Even only a handful support Yuri, as their number one, most of SNSD fans in general, can&rsquo;t help but have her in their top 3. Tiffany&rsquo;s fans might be the most dangerous, but Yuri&rsquo;s fans are the scariest when it comes to fangirling/fanboying."<br /><br />Some people have asked me how i manage my time, since it seems like i'm always doing something SNSD or kpop related many hours a day haha. &nbsp;If my parents ever say anything about my obsession. &nbsp;Again, the Power of Soshi. &nbsp; If i use every minute wisely, then i will be able to complete tasks more efficiently, and eventually get back to SNSD (and kpop). &nbsp;I always do homework and studying first so that i don't have to worry about rushing to finish it at night. &nbsp;Also because my school work ethic goes down the drain after 9:00PM.. I go to a private school that i would say is fairly challenging. &nbsp;My parents don't to seem to have any problem with my addiction, however, because i still stay focused in school and receive all A's. &nbsp;And as for the money i have spent on SNSD stuffs? Let's not go there.... ^-^<br /><br />Well, i had to take a short break from writing this.&nbsp; And it seems like now i can't think of anything else to say.&nbsp; As it is, this "quick paragraph" dragged on a lot longer than i meant it to be. And yet, I still don't think that i said all that i want to say or feel inside of me.&nbsp; I'll probably add more as i go along.&nbsp; I will always have more stuff that i could say about SNSD.&nbsp; There are too many moments for me to recall all that i know and love about them.<br /><br />If you have gone through this whole wall of text, Thank You.&nbsp; If you've just skipped everything to the bottom, Thank You anyways for checking my experimental website haha. I hope this allowed you learn more about "Me", and a bit of what goes on in my mind because i know i lean towards the quiet type who doesn't show his emotions that much. &nbsp;SNSD is now such a big part of my life that i believe if you understand my relationship with them, you will be able to understand me, for better or worse.&nbsp; If this just made me seem weirder, oh well, what can i do. &nbsp;This is the real me :D<br /><br />Hm, and ending... I was always bad at making conclusions.&nbsp; So, i'll make this short with the fanchant at the end of Oh!:<br />Jigeumeun So Nyuh Shi Dae<br />Apeurodo So Nyuh Shi Dae<br />Yongwonhi So Nyuh Shi Dae<br />So Nyuh Shi Dae Saranghae Oh!<br /></div>
